## Rules

Rules are configured as JSON, the format of which must match the schema
provided in `rule-schema.json`.  The fields are:

- destination_topic: Where the message is to be routed to when the rule
  is matched.
- jmespath: A [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) expression to query an
  element within the JSON contained in the message.
- regexp: A
  [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
  that will me used to match against the data returned from `jmespath`.
- source_topic: Were the message is to be sourced from to match this
  rule.

Rules are normally provided as minified JSON, for clarity in these examples,
we're showing them as beutified JSON.
